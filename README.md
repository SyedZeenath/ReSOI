# ReSOI
KDI Hackathon Project

Object Detector:

The Object detector now takes a template image, compares the template wrt the video and gives the location of the part where the 
template got matched in the video.

The location would be the [x,y] coordinates on the video.

Pre-requisites for the Project to run:
1. Visual Studio 2017
2. OpenCV(version used here is 4.1.1)
